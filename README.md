# Live HTML Preview

Live HTML Preview extension for VS Code. This extensions is done for pretty specific use-case (running tests for browser APIs),
but maybe can be useful for other cases.

Opens by command 'Live HTML Preview' from `cmd+p`, reloads page on every change in workspace (not only html itself, because dependencies). Allows JS code and prevents cache of local files in webview.
